# Weather Station

#### Monmouth University: CS-310 - Adv. Object Oriented Programming

---

## Description
A weather station simulation written in C++. The interaction is done through the command line, no GUI is provided. The user will be prompted configuration options. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate structured programming, memory management, data structures and internationalization.

Viewing previous commits will show the development of the program as it began with a simple Hello World application. Input and output and simple control structure were implemented then placed within functions. C arrays are used but vectors would be a better path. Data encapsulation using structs then converted into classes. Finally, internationalization driven by a string server class that prompts the users for a language option (English or Pig Latin). The class reads into a file and searches for a key and returns a value, similiar to a map/dictionary.

## Installation
No installation is required. The **.exe** file can be executed from anywhere. The source code can be clone and modified in any editor. I personally used [Microsoft Visual Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) as my IDE.

## Usage
The program showcases a slice of internationalization using a barebones method seen in Android Studio (string.xml).  

Once executed, the program will prompt the user configuration options, such as the number of weather station(s) desired and the history size for each weather station. Once configured, the user can use the menu to input and view data.

## Credits
The program is created and maintained by Emerson Hidalgo.
